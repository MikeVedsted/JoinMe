# Welcome to JoinMe üëã 
We're a group of full-stack developers, trying our hand at building a social app.  
Stay tuned as this amazing project is about to take off üöÄ  
<br/>

## Intention ‚ú®  
This project is first and foremost intended as a demo project.   
The intention is to gain experience working on a project as a group, while working towards a product built on technologies that are (at the start of the project) both familiar and unfamiliar to the contributing developers.  
<br/>

## Background ‚åõ
The developers on this project have varying backgrounds of self-study, bootcamps and work experience in the industry but all met while studying at Integrify. At the start of this project, they have worked alongside, and supported, each other for about 2.5 months.  
<br/>

## The project üí°
To organise our thoughts, narrow down the scope and give **you** an idea of what we are building, we've composed this table:  
|      |      |  
|------|------|
|**We are building**|An app that let's users connect around sporting activities in their area |
|**For**|People who want to meet new friends while doing sports |
|**Solving the problem of**|Finding people in your area, you do not know yet, who want to do the same sporting activity as yourself|
|**By**|Letting users post and be notified about sports activities, based on their preference settings|
|**Users will be able to**|Create local activity.<br/>Get suggestions for activities created by other users, based on preferences.<br/>Match to an activity.<br/>Communicate directly about activity.<br/>Accept/reject matches for activities they have created.|  
<br/>

|Back end|Express, Node, TypeScript|
